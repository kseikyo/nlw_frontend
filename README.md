# Frontend of ECOLETA

[ECOLETA](https://ecoleta-frontend.netlify.app/) is an web application developed to help people discard waste such as lamps, stacks, batteries and many more. It does so by mapping collection spots so everyone can be in touch with the entity who does the job. The process starts by some entity registering their data into the website, then anyone using the mobile app will be able to see it and get in touch.

## Design

This application's design was made by the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) team and made available during the NLW or Next Level Week, you can currently check the prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1SxgOMojOB2zYT0Mdk28lB/?viewer=1&node-id=)

## Stack

The frontend was built using ReactJS with Typescript. Some requirements were met by using dependencies such as [leaftlet](https://leafletjs.com/) for map interaction, [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for using http requests on the [server](https://github.com/kseikyo/nlw_server), [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) to handle File drag and drop zone, and many more.

## Deploy

The React application for the frontend was deployed [here](https://ecoleta-frontend.netlify.app/) using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the backend along the PostgreSQL Database were deployed using [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
